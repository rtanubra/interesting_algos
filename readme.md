In the pursuit of understanding algorithms and data structure,
I will attempt to capture interesting algos from the web. 
Algorithms I find interesting are those that would dramatically speed up an approach to a traditional problem.


Algorithms:
1. Fibonacci Sequence - add dynamic programming to fast doubling
2. Factorials - requires fast process
3. nCr - add iterative approach to add better insight   
4. Prime Factorization and Divisors (Sieve Algorithms)
5. Generalized Combinations (order does not matter)
    -with replacement 
    -without replacement
6. Permutation (order does matter)
    -with replacement
    -without replacement
