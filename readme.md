In the pursuit of understanding algorithms and data structure,
I will attempt to capture interesting algos from the web. 
Algorithms I find interesting are those that would dramatically speed up an approach to a traditional problem.


Algorithms:
1. Fibonacci Sequence - add dynamic programming to fast doubling
2. Factorials - requires fast process
3. nCr - add iterative approach to add better insight
