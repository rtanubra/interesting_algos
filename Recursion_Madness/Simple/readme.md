This directory wills store several recursion problems and their tests. Recursion is an important part of programming and quite a concept to grasp and play with. Therefore deliberate practice can benefit the developer.

1. BunnyEars2

    We have bunnies standing in a line, numbered 1, 2, ... The odd bunnies (1, 3, ..) have the normal 2 ears. The even bunnies (2, 4, ..) we'll say have 3 ears, because they each have a raised foot. Recursively return the number of "ears" in the bunny line 1, 2, ... n (without loops or multiplication).

2. Triangle

    We have triangle made of blocks. 
    The topmost row has 1 block, the next row down has 2 blocks,
    the next row has 3 blocks, and so on. 
    Compute recursively (no loops or multiplication) 
    the total number of blocks in such a triangle with 
    the given number of rows.

3. SumDigits

    Given a non-negative int n, return the sum of its digits recursively (no loops). Note that mod (%) by 10 yields the rightmost digit (126 % 10 is 6), while divide (/) by 10 removes the rightmost digit (126 / 10 is 12).
