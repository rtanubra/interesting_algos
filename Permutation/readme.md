Looking at several examples of permutations here.
1. calculating_possibilities - completed

    -Goal would be to calculate the total possibilities to we can permutate nPk

2. permutate_string - completed

    -Example of nPn

    -returns a containing all possible permutations of a given string. 

3. print_permutate 

    -similar to permutate string but the goal here would be to print all for nPk
